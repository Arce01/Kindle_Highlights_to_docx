In this repository I solve the problem of turn my Kindle highlights into a functional and easy to read format. I just need to write a Note with one of the following codes for special string-types (such as titles), and once I export my highlights from my mobile app (it's important to have it in English mode in order to work), I download them and run this program from my laptop, getting a docx file in the selected directory.

The code:

· T1: Title 1

· T2: Title 2

· T3: Title 3

· T4: Title 4

· L: Literal, it will appear in italic form, with quotes.

· B1: the first bullet point*

· B2: the last bullet point*

*Between both of them each line will be a different bullet point
